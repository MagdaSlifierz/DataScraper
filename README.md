Data Scraper


This is simple scraper that uses Playwright to extract data from Booking.com

I'm planning a trip to Louisville, KY, and as part of my preparation, I've scraped data from Booking.com to facilitate the hotel selection process for my stay.
Please note that this example is purely for educational purposes and serves as a practical exercise for my upcoming trip.



Check both Excel & CSV files to see how final data will look like.





To Install:
playwright install chromium

to Run:
python3 scrape_data.py
